# Army Intelligence Data Processor

## 📜 Overview
This project is a simulation of an Army Intelligence Data Processing system.  
It was developed as part of a team exercise to practice **Git**, **collaborative development**, and **task management using Trello**.

The Python-based system provides:
- Mission data processing and analysis
- Personnel record analysis
- Automated intelligence report generation
- A simple Command-Line Interface (CLI)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
During the project, we practiced:
- Working with Git:
  - Branching, commits, push, pull, merge, revert
  - Resolving merge conflicts
  - Using `.gitignore` for sensitive or temporary files
- Managing tasks with Trello
- Team collaboration in software development
- Integrating multiple Python modules into a single application
